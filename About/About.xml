    This is a simple re-texture of the Halo faction's UNSC gear for a slight variation. Was weird-ed out the innies in the halo mod was using the exact some gear as the UNSC, as to why this exists.

	Replaces UNSC military apparel on spawn with Insurrectionist variants for pawns belonging to said faction. 
	Designed to make Insurrectionist forces visually different from their UNSC counterparts.

	Any pawn from the insurrection faction will dawn these armor instead of unsc gear.

	Compatible with RimWorld 1.4 through 1.6, and ce.
